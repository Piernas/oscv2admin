### Thank You

To all shopowners, developers, consultants and business owners who have supported the project over the years.

### Support the Project

If you or your employer is commercially dependent on Phoenix (or a previous incarnation), please help to sponsor continual forward movement in the code-base. Phoenix needs you as much as you need Phoenix!

I am hopeful that all shopowners, developers, consultants and businesses ... will join the Phoenix Club to allow two professional developers to work on the code on an ad-hoc basis.
